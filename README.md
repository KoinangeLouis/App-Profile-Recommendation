# App-Profile-Recommendation
I am working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and make our apps available on the Google Play and in the App Store. We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determine our revenue for any given app.
My goal for this project is to analyse data to help developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
